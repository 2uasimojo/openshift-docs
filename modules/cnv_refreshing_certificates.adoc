= Manually refreshing TLS certificates

The TLS certificates for {ProductName} components are created at the time
of installation and are valid for one year. You must manually refresh
these certificates before they expire.

To refresh the TLS certificates for {ProductName}, download and run the `rotate-certs` script. This script is available from the `kubevirt/hyperconverged-cluster-operator` repository on GitHub.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When refreshing the certificates, the following operations are impacted:

* Migrations are canceled
* Image uploads are canceled
* VNC and console connections are closed
====

.Prerequisites
