= Multi-tenant {ProductName} installation

The {ProductName} operator provides support for multi-tenant control plane installations. A multi-tenant control plane is configured so that only specified namespaces can be joined into its {ProductShortName}, isolating the mesh from other installations.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use multi-tenant control plane installations in conjunction with a cluster-wide control plane installation. {ProductName} installations must either be multi-tenant or single, cluster-wide installations.
====

[WARNING]
====
Automatic route creation is currently incompatible with multi-tenant {ProductShortName} installations. Ensure that it is disabled, by setting `ior_enabled` to `false` in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` if you plan to attempt a multi-tenant installation.
====

== Known issues

* `MeshPolicy` is still a cluster-scoped resource and applies to all control planes installed in OpenShift. This can prevent the installation of multiple control planes or cause unknown behavior if one control plane is deleted.
* The Jaeger agent runs as a `DaemonSet`, therefore `tracing` may only be enabled for a single `ServiceMeshControlPlane` instance.
* If you delete the project that contains the control plane before you delete the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, some parts of the installation may not be removed:
** Service accounts added to the `SecurityContextConstraints` may not be removed.
** `OAuthClient` resources associated with Kiali may not be removed, or its list of redirectURIs may not be accurate.

== Comparison of multi-tenant and cluster-wide installations

The main difference between a multi-tenant installation and a cluster-wide installation is the scope of privileges used by the control plane deployments, for example, Galley and Pilot. The components no longer use cluster-scoped Role Based Access Control (RBAC) `ClusterRoleBinding`, but rely on namespace-scoped RBAC `RoleBinding`. Every namespace in the `members` list will have a `RoleBinding` for each service account associated with a control plane deployment and each control plane deployment will only watch those member namespaces. Each member namespace has a `maistra.io/member-of` label added to it, where the `member-of` value is the namespace containing the control plane installation.

== Configuring a multi-tenant installation

You can configure a multi-tenant installation by setting the `multitenant` option to `true` in the istio section of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example,

.Multi-tenant custom resource example

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
  kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
  spec:
    istio:
      # enable multitenant
    	multitenant: true
       # additional control plane configuration details
----

== Configuring {ProductName} namespaces in multi-tenant installations

A multi-tenant control plane installation only affects namespaces configured as part of the {ProductShortName}. You must specify the namespaces associated with the {ProductShortName} in a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource located in the same namespace as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource and name it `default`. Here is an example that joins the bookinfo namespace into the {ProductShortName}:

.Namespace configuration example

[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
  kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
  metadata:
    name: default
  spec:
    members:
    # a list of namespaces joined into the service mesh
    - bookinfo
----

You can add any number of namespaces, but a namespace can only belong to *one* `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

`ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resources are reconciled in response to the following events:

* The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created, updated, or deleted
* The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource in the namespace containing the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created or updated
* A namespace listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is created or deleted

The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` is deleted when its corresponding `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is deleted.


[NOTE]
====
The member namespaces are only updated if the control plane installation is successful.
