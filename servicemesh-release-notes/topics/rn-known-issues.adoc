After eating an extra garlic pizza, Chris has bad breath and nobody wants to work closely with them.  As a workaround, Chris can take a breath mint, or avoid ordering extra garlic on their pizza.

These known issues or limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* {ProductName} does not support multi-tenancy.

* {ProductName} does not support IPv6, as it it not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift.

* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability. The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-470[MAISTRA-470] If you include the control plane namespace in the member roll, the reconciliation process produces an error that spams the logs and prevents the status of the configuredMembers list from updating even for members that were successfully configured.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-469[MAISTRA-469] If you delete a project before deleting the ServiceMeshControlPlane, the cleanup process does not execute for resources in the deleted project. Service accounts added to the SecurityContextConstraints are not removed and the Kiali OAuthClient resource is not updated properly.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-465[MAISTRA-465] The Maistra operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-420[MAISTRA-420] [Multi-tenant implementation] The Jaeger agent pods are unscheduled as a result of port collission in multi-tenancy deplouments on OpenShift 4.1.rc.5.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-462[MAISTRA-462] [Multi-tenant implementation] After adding a namespace member to a second control plane, Kiali does not display the namespace member in the namespace list because the namespace for the second control plane is missing the `maistra.io/member-of` and `istio.openshift.io/member-of` labels. This is a result of the installation of the second control plane failing due to https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-464[MAISTRA-464](the operator can't create the `istio-ingressgateway` service in the second control plane, because the NodePort already being used by the first control plane). The workaround is to manually change the node ports of the `istio-ingressgateway` service in the first control plane's namespace (using `oc edit svc`). The operator will then be able to finish deploying the second control plane.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-466[MAISTRA-466] [Multi-tenant implementation] When you install more than one control plane, the operator overwrites the Kiali oauthclient yaml on any existing Kiali installations so that only the most recent installation functions. The Kiali oauthclient (`oc get oauthclients kiali`) contains a list of the authorized URLs that OpenShift OAuth will redirect to. If your URL is not part of this list, then the oauth login will fail and return the following message:

----
`{"error":"invalid_request","error_description":"The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed."}
----

The workaround is to ensure that the redirectURIs in the oautclient match the URLs of all the available Kiali routes.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2942[KIALI-2942] When using OpenShift OAuth, when you click the logout link, you are still logged into the Kiali console. When you go to the login URL it will check your cookies and then automatically log you back in.  The workaround is to delete the Kiali cookie.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-348[MAISTRA-348] To access a TCP service by using the ingress gateway on a port other than 80 or 443, use the service hostname provided by the AWS load balancer rathe than the OpenShift router.

The istio-ingressgateway route hostname (for example, `istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.[cluster name].openshift.com`) works with port 80 or port 443 traffic. However, that route hostname does not support other port traffic.

To access service(s) running on the ingress gateway TCP port(s), you can retrieve the istio-ingressgateway external hostname (for example,
`[uuid].[aws region].elb.amazonaws.com`) and then check traffic by using that external hostname value.

To retrieve the external IP hostname value, issue this command:

----
$ oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
----

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-357[MAISTRA-357] In OpenShift 4 Beta on AWS, it is not possible, out of the box, to access a TCP or HTTPS service through the ingress gateway on a port other than port 80. The AWS load balancer has a health check that verifies if port 80 on the service endpoint is active.

The load balancer health check only checks the first port defined in the Istio ingress gateway ports list. This port is configured as 80/HTTP:31380/TCP. Without a service running on this port, the load balancer health check fails.

To check HTTPS or TCP traffic by using an ingress gateway, you must have an existing HTTP service, for example, the Bookinfo sample application product page running on the ingress gateway port 80. Alternatively, using the AWS EC2 console, you can change the port that the load balancer uses to perform the health check, and replace 80 with the port your service actually uses.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2671[KIALI-2671] If you *do not* specify a dashboard user/password in the control plane custom resource  the operator will use Oauth for the installation. The OpenShift strategy for using Oauth does not work in {ProductName} {ProductVersion} Technology Preview 10. As a workaround, ensure that you provide a user and password in the custom resource.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-110[MAISTRA-110] In large clusters, citadel can take a significant amount of time to create secrets. This may cause the installation to fail.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-108[MAISTRA-108] Part of the process to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in an {product-title} cluster is to run the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/installing-operator-framework.html#installing-olm-using-ansible_installing-operator-framework[registry authorization playbook], but an error prevents the process from completing successfully.

The task "openshift_control_plane : Check for file paths outside of /etc/origin/master in master's config" fails because if finds "/dev/null" string within the master-config.yaml file. This string is added when we patch the configuration when preparing the cluster to install Istio.

Here are the two webhooks:

Create a soft link from `/var/lib/origin/null` to `/dev/null` and replace the two kubeConfigFile variables to `/var/lib/origin/null`. This makes the task think /var/lib/origin/null is an asset in the origin "perimiter" and continue running.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-62[MAISTRA-62] After a successful Istio installation, when upgrading an OCP cluster from 3.10 to 3.11, the storage upgrade task fails causing the entire upgrade process to fail.

https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.
