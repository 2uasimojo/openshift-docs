If you have a standalone {gluster} cluster available in your environment, you
can make use of volumes on that cluster using {product-title}'s GlusterFS
volume plug-in. This solution is a conventional deployment where applications
run on dedicated compute nodes, an {product-title} cluster, and storage is
provided from its own dedicated nodes.
